Abstract
We are going to solve the Exercise3 building the microservices based system to solve the use cases of "ikeaen casa" project.
Three web services will be build using the standards explained in class and they will be deployed in a docker container and brought to production
using amazon web services ec2, ubuntu server and docker.
During the practice we'll use docker compose and for production it is better to use swarm to orchestrate and manage the web services.

Step 1)
  Launch ubuntu server through aws ec2

Step 2)
Get docker customer edition for ubuntu
https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/

Step 3)
Prepare the build image and commit it to the user registry
  - maven
  - oracle jdk
  - apache tomcat

Step 4)
Open IDE and link local workspace with the build container

Step 5)
Develop the actual web services required for the essay
